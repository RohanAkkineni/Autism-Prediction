# Autism-Prediction-with-KANs
Use various machine learning models and assess their performance using KAN. Enhance trust and interpretability by applying the XAI technique, SHAP, to the 100 predicted outputs of the Support Vector Classifier model. Additionally, apply Random Oversampling to address class imbalance and evaluate its effectiveness.
